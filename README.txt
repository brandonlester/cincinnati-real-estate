Cincinnati Real Estate

*IN PROGRESS*

Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) for neighborhoods in the Cincinnati metro area are analyzed to see current home values as well as changes over the last 25 years.

Scripts/wrangle.R preps the raw data from Zillow Research for analysis and adds on latitude and longitude for each neighborhood in the Cincinnati metro area.

The resulting data is used in a Tableau map which can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brandon.lester/viz/CincinnatiRealEstate_16243183074010/Map_1

The data was exported from https://www.zillow.com/research/data/. Specifically, under Home Values, the ZHVI Single-Family Homes Time Series ($) data type with Neighborhood geography was downloaded.
